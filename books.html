                <p>From a brilliant new talent comes a riveting novel of chance, fate, and numbers, and one man's
                    strange journey
                    past the boundaries of the possible.David Caine inhabits a world of obsession, rich rewards, and
                    rapid,
                    destructive downfalls. A compulsive gambler and brilliant mathematician prone to crippling epileptic
                    seizures,
                    he possesses the uncanny ability to calculate odds of any hand in the blink of an eye. But one night
                    at an
                    underground poker club, Caine makes a costly misscalculation, sending his life spinning out of
                    control.
                    Desperate, he agrees to test an experimental drug with unnerving side effects: inexplicable visions
                    of the past,
                    present, and future. Unsure whether he's perceiving an alternate reality or suffering a psychotic
                    breakdown,
                    Caine embarks on a journey that stretches beyond the possible into the world of the improbable.
                    Gradually, he
                    discovers the extent of his astonishing new ability -- but powerful, shadowy forces know Caine's
                    secret. Now
                    Caine must fight for his survival -- and his sanity . . .

                <p>From the Big Bang to Black Holes is a popular-science book on cosmology (the study of
                    the universe) by British physicist Stephen Hawking. It was first published in 1988. Hawking wrote
                    the book
                    for nonspecialist readers with no prior knowledge of scientific theories. In A Brief History of
                    Time, Hawking
                    writes in non-technical terms about the structure, origin, development and eventual fate of the
                    universe, which
                    is the object of study of astronomy and modern physics. He talks about basic concepts like space and
                    time, basic
                    building blocks that make up the universe (such as quarks) and the fundamental forces that govern it
                    (such as
                    gravity). He writes about cosmological phenomena such as the Big Bang and black holes. He discusses
                    two major
                    theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics, that modern scientists use to describe the
                    universe.
                    Finally, he talks about the search for a unifying theory that describes everything in the universe
                    in a coherent
                    manner.

                <p>Cosmos is a 1980 popular science book by astronomer and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Carl Sagan.It
                    has 13
                    chapters, corresponding to the 13 episodes of the Cosmos television series. The book covers a broad
                    range of
                    topics, comprising Sagan's reflections on
                    anthropological, cosmological, biological, historical, and astronomical matters from antiquity to
                    contemporary
                    times. Sagan reiterates his position on extraterrestrial life—that the magnitude of the universe
                    permits the
                    existence of thousands of alien civilizations, but no credible evidence exists to demonstrate that
                    such life has
                    ever visited earth. Sagan explores 15 billion years of cosmic evolution and the development of
                    science and
                    civilization. He traces the origins of knowledge and the scientific method, mixing science and
                    philosophy,
                    and speculates about the future of science.

                <p>The Little Prince (French: Le Petit Prince) , first published in April
                    1943, is a novella, the most famous work of French aristocrat, writer, poet, and pioneering aviator
                    Antoine de
                    Saint-Exupéry. Though ostensibly styled as a children's book, The Little Prince makes several
                    observations about
                    life and human nature. For example, Saint-Exupéry tells of a fox meeting the young prince during his
                    travels
                    on Earth. The story's essence is contained in the fox saying that "One sees clearly only with the
                    heart. The
                    essential is invisible to the eye." Other key morals articulated by the fox are: "You become
                    responsible,
                    forever, for what you have tamed," and "It is the time you have lost for your rose that makes your
                    rose so
                    important." The fox's messages are arguably the book's most famous quotations because they deal with
                    human
                    relationships. The novella has been voted the best book of the 20th century in France. Translated
                    into 300
                    languages and dialects, selling nearly two million copies annually, and with year-to-date sales of
                    over
                    140 million copies worldwide, it has become one of the best-selling and most translated books ever
                    published.

                <p>Digital Fortress is a techno-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and published in
                    1998 by St.
                    Martin's Press. The book explores the theme of government surveillance of electronically stored
                    information on
                    the private lives of citizens, and the possible civil liberties and ethical implications of using
                    such
                    technology. The novel begins as members of the United States’ National Security Agency encounter a
                    piece of code
                    that TRANSLTR is unable to break. Commander Trevor Strathmore reaches out to the NSA’s head
                    cryptographer, Susan
                    Fletcher, asking her to try to break it. After precursory research, Fletcher discovers a former NSA
                    operative
                    Ensei Tankado created the code. Tankado had become disillusioned with the purpose of the NSA after
                    finding that
                    it routinely pries into the private data of citizens without just cause. Tankado presents an
                    ultimatum to the
                    NSA wherein he will reveal his cryptographic code, “Digital Fortress,” to the world via an auction
                    to the
                    highest bidder unless the NSA informs the American public about the nature of TRANSLTR. If he dies,
                    he has a
                    provision in place that allows his partner, who goes by “North Dakota,” to release the code for
                    free. In
                    response, the NSA resolves to stop Digital Fortress through other means.
