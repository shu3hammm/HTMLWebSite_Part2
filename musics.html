                <p>"Leave This Island" is the third music from the "Too Much Information", the fifth studio album by
                    English
                    indie
                    rock band Maximo Park. The bulk of the album was recorded under the supervision of guitarist Duncan
                    Lloyd at the
                    band's own studio in Newcastle towards the end of 2013, but recording initially started at the
                    studio of
                    Peter
                    and David Brewis of Field Music. The album also included production contributions from Dave Okumu
                    from
                    The
                    Invisible and was mixed by Nicolas Vernhes who previously worked with Deerhunter on Monomania.
                    B-sides
                    from the
                    album campaign include "A Vague Implication" (from "Leave This Island") and "When I'm Alone" (from
                    "Midnight On
                    The Hill").Too Much Information received positive reviews from critics upon release. All lyrics
                    by
                    Paul
                    Smith; all music by Duncan Lloyd, except 3 songs.

                <p>"It's A War" is the first and most well-known music from the album "Boracay Planet" by San
                    Francisco-based
                    electronic musician Mikey Maramag. His warm,
                    textural synth pop and distant, dreamy vocals recall acts like Four Tet and Washed Out, though
                    Maramag's
                    roots
                    are actually in metal and hardcore. Originally hailing from Hawaii, he relocated to Northern
                    California
                    and
                    began his career as the drummer for Bay Area hardcore band Murder Practice. His blissed-out,
                    sunny dream pop was well-received and he signed with San Francisco indie Lavish Habits to release
                    his
                    follow-up
                    EP, 2012's Boracay Planet. Tours of the U.S. and Europe followed as he continued to evolve his live
                    set-up and
                    in 2013, it was announced he had signed to prominent San Francisco electronic label Om Records who
                    released his
                    second LP, Tangerine Sky, in June 2014.

                <p>"6 Underground" is the third music from the debut studio album "Becoming X" by English electronic
                    band
                    Sneaker
                    Pimps. It was first released in the United Kingdom by Clean Up Records and
                    in the United States by Virgin Records. The album marked the only appearance of Kelli Dayton as lead
                    singer
                    before she was asked to leave the
                    band; Chris Corner replaced her for the band's subsequent albums.Becoming X was commercially
                    successful
                    in the
                    United Kingdom, while "6 Underground" and "Spin Spin Sugar" would become hits in the United States.
                    Fueled by
                    the success of the former single, the album spent 23 consecutive weeks on the US Billboard 200.

                <p>"Line Of Fire" is the first song from "Junip" album which is the second LP by Swedish based indie
                    rock
                    band
                    Junip. The album was released April 22, 2013 on City
                    Slang (Europe) and the following day on Mute (North America). Junip received mostly positive reviews
                    from music
                    critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream
                    critics,
                    the album received a metascore of 76, based on 17 reviews. At FILTER, Zach Kraimer highlighted how
                    this
                    album
                    like their last "finds them occupying the same melancholy, earnest spaces", and told that the band
                    "have
                    since
                    outgrown some restrictive boundaries." Heather Phares of Allmusic called the release "even more of a
                    grower"
                    than their previous offering, which is done "in more ways than one", such as "bigger arrangements
                    and
                    productions" and in their songwriting.

                <p>"Mykonos" is the 4th song from the album "Sun Giant" which is the second EP by Seattle-based indie
                    folk
                    band
                    Fleet Foxes. It was released on April 8, 2008, on
                    Bella Union and Sub Pop. The EP was named the #1 album of the year by Pitchfork Media in conjunction
                    with their
                    debut LP, Fleet Foxes. While the EP was released prior to their debut album, Fleet Foxes, the songs
                    on
                    Sun Giant
                    were recorded after those that feature on their full-length album. The band stated that the EP was
                    pressed so
                    that they had something to sell on tour, and clarified that the music was not indicative of their
                    ambitions.
                    Sun Giant was in fact originally intended to be a tour only release, but demand from fans led to its
                    official
                    release. Billboard said that the EP featured "harmony-rich songs more in keeping with Crosby, Stills
                    &
                    Nash, a
                    welcome turn away from the agitated dance-rock still so prominent in the indie world."
